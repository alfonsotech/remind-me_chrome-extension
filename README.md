# remind-me_chrome-extension

Built this chrome extension for one of my Twitter followers who was joking about an app that would run this dialogue whenever you tried to use Tiwtter.
I wanted a simple project to build one of my first chrome extensions and this was a good project idea. 

#### Thanks to @modallyyours @AidanMcGlynn, and especially to @Natalan for the inspiration for this game.

## Instructions For Playing Remind-Me

### Getting the Files
0. In this window, there is a green button in the upper right-hand corner that says "Clone or Download." Click on this button, then select "Dowload" to download the code files to your computer. Navigate to where you dowloaded this on your computer and double click on the folder to unzip them. 

### Installing the Extension In Your Chrome Browser
1. In your Chrome web browser, open "chrome://extensions/"
2. In the upper right hand corner, click "Developer Mode" to select it.
3. You will now have two option buttons appear at the top of the extensions page. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button.
4. This opens your finder, select the folder where you keep the "remind-me" folder and click "Select".

### Playing
5. Navigate to Twitter and play the game; it will take a couple seconds to begin once you arrive at Twitter.
6. If you are an honest user/player, you'll have no issues; but if you are not an honest user/player something that is NOT PERMANENT will happen in your browser window. Just refresh your screen at the end of the game. :-)

### Uninstall 
7. To uninstall the extension, simply click on it's icon (a bandaged finger) in the extension toolbar (upper right hand corner of your web browser and select "Remove from Chrome"), then refresh your web browser page.
