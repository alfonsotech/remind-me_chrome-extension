Instructions For Playing Remind-Me

1. In your Chrome web browser, open "chrome://extensions/"
2. In the upper right hand corner, click "Developer Mode" to select it.
3. You will now have two option buttons appear at the top of the extensions page. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button.
4. This opens your finder, select the folder where you keep the "remind-me" folder and click "Select".
5. Navigate to Twitter and play the game; it will take a couple seconds to begin once you arrive at Twitter.
6. If you are an honest user/player, you'll have no issues; but if you are not an honest user/player something that is NOT PERMANENT will happen in your browser window. Just refresh your screen at the end of the game. :-)
